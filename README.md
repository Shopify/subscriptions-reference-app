# Shopify Subscriptions Reference app

## About The Project

The Shopify Subscriptions Reference app is an example of how to build a Subscriptions application with [Remix](https://remix.run/). This is a fully featured app with performance, flexibility, and extensions built-in and acts as a reference for building Shopify apps.

We developed the Shopify Subscriptions Reference app with the following in mind:

- **Build a custom subscriptions solution** that meets your commerce needs.
- **Build faster** using the source code from the [Shopify Subscriptions Reference app](https://apps.shopify.com/shopify-subscriptions).
- **The core [building blocks](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/purchase-options/subscriptions/subscriptions-app/core-system-components) you need to build an app** that integrates with Shopifyâ€™s ecosystem.

Use this app as your starting point for building better applications. Feel free to expand upon it!

> Note:
> The Shopify Subscriptions Reference app serves as the foundation for the [Shopify Subscription application](https://apps.shopify.com/shopify-subscriptions).

## Getting Started

To create a new subscriptions app, use the [Shopify CLI](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/shopify-cli) and run the installation command.

```bash
shopify app init --template https://github.com/Shopify/subscriptions-app
```

This command clones the Shopify Subscription App repository and installs all the dependencies needed to run the app.

Follow the [Shopify Subscriptions Reference app documentation](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/purchase-options/subscriptions/subscriptions-app/start-building) to learn how to run the application.

### Clone the app

You can also clone the app from the repository, once you have cloned the app, you can install the dependencies by running one of the following commands:

```bash
npm install
```

```bash
yarn install
```

```bash
pnpm install
```

From there, you can follow the [Shopify Subscriptions Reference app documentation](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/purchase-options/subscriptions/subscriptions-app/start-building) to learn how to run the application and ask for scopes.
